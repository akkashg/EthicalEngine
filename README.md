# EthicalEngine

The idea of Ethical Engines is based on the Trolley Dilemma, a fictional scenario presenting a decision-maker with a moral
dilemma: choosing ''the lesser of two evils''. The scenario entails an autonomous car whose brakes fail at a pedestrian crossing.
As it is too late to relinquish control to the car's passengers, the car needs to make a decision based on the facts available
about the situation.
